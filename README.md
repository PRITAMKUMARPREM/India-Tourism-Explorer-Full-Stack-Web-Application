# India-Tourism-Explorer-Full-Stack-Web-Application

🌏 India Tourism Explorer – Full Stack Web Application
India Tourism Explorer is a full-stack web application designed to help users easily explore popular tourist destinations across Indian States and Union Territories. The project focuses on providing structured, accurate, and easily searchable tourism data using a clean frontend and a powerful backend API.
The backend is built using Node.js and Express.js, where all tourism data is stored in a structured JSON format. Each state or union territory includes a base station, nearby tourist places, distance details, airport connectivity, and visual references through images. A smart search API allows users to find destinations not only by full state names but also by abbreviations (e.g., DL → Delhi, JK → Jammu and Kashmir) and partial matches, making the system flexible and user-friendly.
The frontend interacts with the backend using REST APIs and Fetch, dynamically displaying results without page reloads. Once a user searches for a state or UT, the app instantly shows the base station and a list of major tourist attractions with distance information. Error handling ensures a smooth user experience by displaying meaningful messages when invalid inputs are entered.
